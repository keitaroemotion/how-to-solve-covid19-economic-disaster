# MytownVR

Nowadays, because of the COVID 19, our economy is at risk, taking into account this situation is going to be prolonged so far, we need a VR/3D platform to support 'random shopping' and any face-to-face social activities via the internet, using this online VR.
Remember when the Second Life becomes popular long times ago, we enjoyed it but it won't last long. 
However, in this tough situation we need to re-consider building our society online, as more visible format.

There are two types of VR|3Ds we need to provide:

1. shopVR|3D
2. workVR|3d #workfromhome

# shopVR

The platform to enhance the shopping malls, shopping sites, bars, et cetra.

- Unity3D / 2D correlated to Geo location map.
- a bit close the Second Life, the virtual reality related SNS years ago.
- It is a platform which enhances the shopping malls, shopping sites, bars, et cetra.
- VR also supported.

1. Clients apply for the address of their virtual geolocations, and they can arrange their store
   freely.
2. If it is shopping mall or department store, the big 3D object of the buildging are provided
   and there are bunch of shops. (corresponding to the real ones)
3. If it is apparel store, the user can walk around and can try clothes by putting them on their
   avatar.
4. If it is a bar, the following procedures are:
   - initially, they order drink sequences.
   - after the drink provided, they login (as VR or 3D) to the bar and enjoy drinking with the 
     other avatars(they can chat with the other avatars or if they want they can flirt). 
5. If it is a convenient store, they also can walk around in the convini and shop around.
   - convini supports any kind of convini payment via counter, with VR.
   - we support this payment as platform.

# workVR
now a lot of companies does telework, but for instance some of the other clerk also can be hosted in this VR city and provide their services in workVR.


# governmentVR
Any govermental procedure would be done on line, the support can be done via this VR.


# summary

we need to provide the social platform, including goverment thing to support people's economic activity on line, in more visible forms. if we succeeded in supplying it, probably we gonna save the dying industries much more than in the current situation.
